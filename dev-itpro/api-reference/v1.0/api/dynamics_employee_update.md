```

## Request headers (v1.0)

|Header         |Value                     |
|---------------|--------------------------|
|Authorization  |Bearer {token}. Required. |
|Content-Type   |application/json.         |
|If-Match       |Required. When this request header is included and the eTag provided does not match the current tag on the **employees**, the **employees** will not be updated. |
